Chapter 4 discusses setting up remote repositories and a personal Git server. It also discusses
how to share your code with other users on the same server, as well as tips on how to maintain
your own Git server. 
There are various things you can do on your Git server: 
one of them is setting up a web-based visualizer (GitWeb), for monitoring your repository;
another is installing a full-featured Git server (GitLab), which allows for user groups and
permissions support, as well as providing fellow users on the same server access to your
repositories for collaborative work.
Otherwise, there are options for third-party Git server hosting, one of which is GitHub.
