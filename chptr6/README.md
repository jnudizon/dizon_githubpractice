Chapter 6 discusses GitHub, the single largest host for Git repositories. Many, if not all
Git repositories are hosted on GitHub. The chapter discusses how to setup a GitHub account,
customizing one's profile, setting up authentication for account security, contributing to a 
project (through forking), the GitHub collaboration workflow, maintaining a project,
managing an organization, and scripting GitHub to make it work the way the user wants it to.

Forking a project means contributing to a project to which one does not have direct push access
to. Changes are contributed to the original via a pull request, which can be reviewed by the
project owner and merged into the master branch.

Organizations on GitHub represent a group of people with shared ownership of projects, GitHub
provides tools for managing subgroups of these people; these accounts are used for open source
groups or companies. An owner of an organization can also divide developers into teams, and log
all information on the goings-on of the organization page.
